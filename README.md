The idea for this repo came from my frustration with job searching—many times, I feel like I need to talk directly to LinkedIn and explain exactly what I want (and don’t want) in a job search.

Too often, I find myself overwhelmed by the amount of manual work required to find relevant job postings, filter through them, and apply. It’s time-consuming, repetitive, and, honestly, exhausting.

So, I decided to build HuntMate—an AI-powered job search assistant—to make my own job hunt easier and, hopefully, help others too!

Since a true mate should be able to handle a variety of requests, HuntMate is an **LLM agent** at its core, powered by `GPT-4o-mini`. However, you can swap out the LLM with any model of your choice.

🛠️ Development is currently in progress, and I'm aiming to release the first version by the end of February. Keep an eye out for updates!
