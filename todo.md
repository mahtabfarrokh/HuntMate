# TODO List

## High Priority
- Task 1: Add a place that the user can upload their resume!
- Task 2: Make suggestions on how to improve the resume based on the job description
- Task 3: Add prompts for craft email.
- Task 4: Make sure you are nicely handling the history/memory sequence. 
- Task 5: Change unsupported task to a more user-friendly message or just let openai handle it?


## Medium Priority
- Task 1: Check how would other LLMs work with the current implementation setup.
    - Also any LLM that you check and works, put it in a dropdown manu in the UI for the user to pick.
- Task 2: Switch to Promptlayer and remove it from the codebase.

## Low Priority
- Task 1: Remove the extra bits that I don't use from `my_linkedin_api` to keep it clean.
- Task 2: Improve the memory from csv file to a better solution: can you chrome db or redis if we don't need the vector part.
- Task 3: Update the diagram it's ugly!
- Task 4: (Final step) Use py2exe, to generate a .exe file for the app, or maybe use git-release?
