# TODO List

## High Priority
- Task 1: Add Indeed Scrapping to the pipeline
- Task 2: Add prompts for craft email.
- Task 3: Change unsupported task to a more user-friendly message or just let openai handle it?
- Task 4: More multi-threading is needed! It should'nt take so much time for loading jobs.

## Medium Priority
- Task 1: Check how would other LLMs work with the current implementation setup.
    - Also any LLM that you check and works, put it in a dropdown manu in the UI for the user to pick.
- Task 2: Make suggestions on how to improve the resume based on the job description

## Low Priority
- Task 1: Remove the extra bits that I don't use from `my_linkedin_api` to keep it clean.
- Task 2: Add new chat button to reset the memory
- Task 3: Add a place that the user can upload their resume!
- Task 4: (Final step) Use py2exe, to generate a .exe file for the app, or maybe use git-release?
- Task 5: Improve the memory from csv file to a better solution
